# Here are some aliases and enviroment varaibles that are not suitable

# Improve colored output by ls.
eval "$(dircolors -b)"
# - `--color=auto` enables colorized output for the `ls` command,
# with colors indicating different file types and attributes.
alias l="ls --color=auto" # Override internal alias fron ohmyzsh.
# - `-a` (or `--all`) shows all files, including hidden files
# (those that start with a dot).
# - `-l` (or `--long`) shows the files in a long format, with details
# such as permissions, owner, size, and modification time.
# - `-F` (or `--classify`) adds a trailing character to each file name
# to indicate its type (e.g., `/` for directories, `*` for executables,
# `@` for symbolic links).
# - `-h` (or `--human-readable`) shows file sizes in a human-readable format
# (e.g., "1.2K" instead of "1234").
# - `--color=auto` enables colorized output for the `ls` command,
# with colors indicating different file types and attributes.
alias ll="ls -alFh --color=auto" # Override internal alias fron ohmyzsh.

# Other coretuils.
# Add safe features to rm and give feedboacks when deleting files.
# - `-I` (or `--interactive`) prompts the user before deleting any files,
# to confirm that they really want to delete them. This is a safety feature
# that helps prevent accidental deletions.
# - `-v` (or `--verbose`) prints the name of each file as it is deleted,
# to provide feedback to the user.
# - `--one-file-system` prevents `rm` from crossing file system boundaries
# when deleting files. This is another safety feature
# that helps prevent accidental deletions of files on other file systems.
