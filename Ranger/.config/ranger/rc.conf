# ===================================================================
# This file contains the user-spec startup commands for ranger.
# Overwrite some default system configs.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Use non-default path for file preview script?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.
#set preview_script ~/.config/ranger/scope.sh

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text or image previews?
set use_preview_script true

# Open all images in this directory when running certain image viewers
# like feh or sxiv?  You can still open selected files by marking them.
set open_all_images true

# Be aware of version control systems and display information.
set vcs_aware true

# Truncate the long commit messages to this length when shown in the statusbar.
set vcs_msg_length 50

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
#
set preview_images_method kitty

# Use a unicode "..." character to mark cut-off filenames?
set unicode_ellipsis true

# Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
# default, jungle, snow, solarized
set colorscheme solarized

# Use fuzzy tab completion with the "cd" command. For example,
# ":cd /u/lo/b<tab>" expands to ":cd /usr/local/bin".
set cd_tab_fuzzy true

# Disable displaying line numbers in main column.
# Possible values: false, absolute, relative.
set line_numbers relative
